She gave a demo on how to make submissions for datathon using a sample data set, how to fork notebooks and much more. She also made students visualise  data sets using various visualisation tools such as matplotlib and pandas. Python Refresher course was conducted for students who were not very confident with it, which revised python concepts in brief. Usha also mentioned about the vast opportunities that the Kaggle platform holds for all the budding Data Scientists and how they can take baby steps into Deep learning. It was great to see someone as experienced and knowledgeable as her to  bring in so much enthusiasm and keep the students engaged for a duration of 5 hours.",

On the first day attendees were introduced to the concept of ML and its applications and also the opportunities it beholds. We also conducted fun tutorials to explain ML in simple terms. Neural networks and tensor flow were covered on the first day. The second day mainly focused on the math behind ML, hence topics like regression, vectorization, linear algebra, linear regression were familiarised. By the end of the second day attendees were asked to code on Google Colabs and get a hands on experience of ML. In order to review the understanding of participants a fun interactive quiz called Kahoot was conducted which assessed their knowledge for the day. Winners of the quiz were given goodies. This workshop received an overwhelming response from the participants and we are looking forward to having another ML workshop later in the month of November.",

Later a bonus page was displayed which tested their knowledge and understanding level. The participants enthusiastically took part in the competition and made it a great success. Five people were shortlisted and were interviewed further. The selected candidates would be trained by DSC JSSSTU to become full stack developers. They are now interns and would be working on real projects. They would also play a prominent role in designing the Computer Science Department’s web page in JSSSTU website.",
